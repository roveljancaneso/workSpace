"A graph of people's mood by their tweets between July 14 and July 21, 2020, can be depicted" 
"as three types of emotions: negative, neutral, and positive. From the graph shown above, a" 
"high quantity of negative tweets can be observed on these days with an unevenly larger number" 
"on July 15 and 21. There is a smaller amount of positive tweets, which can be noticed on some" 
"days, with a constant neutral number throughout the week. By utilizing the ggplot2 of the R" 
"programming, this graph can be employed for text data classification, determination of" 
"frequency of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment, and identification of trends in" 
"large datasets."
