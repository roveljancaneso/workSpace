***Number 1***
```{r}
#[1.] Create a data frame.
#   a. Describe the data.
#      [Outputs a table for the data that is inside the data frame.]
shoeDetails <- data.frame(
  Shoe_size = c(6.5, 9.0, 8.5, 8.5, 10.5, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 13.0, 7.5, 10.5, 8.5, 12.0, 10.5, 13.0, 11.5, 8.5, 5.0, 10.0, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 8.5, 10.5, 11.0, 9.0, 13.0),
  Height = c(66.0, 68.0, 64.5, 65.0, 70.0, 64.0, 70.0, 71.0, 72.0, 64.0, 74.5, 67.0, 71.0, 71.0, 77.0, 72.0, 59.0, 62.0, 72.0, 66.0, 64.0, 67.0, 73.0, 69.0, 72.0, 70.0, 69.0, 70.0),

shoeDetails

#   b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height.
#      What its result? Show the R scripts.
male <- subset(shoeDetails, shoeDetails$Gender == "M")
male
female <- subset(shoeDetails, shoeDetails$Gender == "F")
female

#   c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its
#      result.
mean(shoeDetails$Shoe_size)
mean(shoeDetails$Height)

#   d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?
#      [Yes, because the taller the person it is also the same with their shoe size,
#       but not exactly all the time.]
```

***Number 2***
```{r}
#[2.] Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to
#     factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out
#     the factor levels below the actual values.
months <- c("March","April","January","November","January",
"September","October","September","November","August",
"January","November","November","February","May","August",
"July","December","August","August","September","November","February","April")
months

factMonths <- factor(months)
factMonths
levels(factMonths)
```

***Number 3***
```{r}
#[3.] Check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. | Interpret 
#     the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?
summary(months)
summary(factMonths)
#   [The summary of the vector months only gives the length, class, and mode of the vector
#    which is not that much useful, unlike the summary of the factored months which provides 
#    a detailed frequency count of each level in the factor, which is much more useful
#    in understanding how often each month appears.]
```

***Number 4***
```{r}
#[4.] Create a vector and factor for the table below.
direction <- data.frame(
  Direction = c("East", "West", "North"),
  Frequency = c(1,4,3)
)
direction
